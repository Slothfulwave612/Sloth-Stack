    "**Hendrik Johannes Cruijff OON**, aka *Johan Cruyff*, is the most influential and revolutionary figure in the history of FC Barcelona and has an iconic presence in the history of football. The success of modern-day FC Barcelona is all because of the ideas and principles implemented by Cruyff during his managerial tenure from 1988-1996. Cruyff's principles gave an identity that changed FC Barcelona forever. It also helped Spain laying a systematic foundation for their period of dominance (2008-2012) in world football."

    "# Prelude\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 1988, as the season (1987-88) was coming close to its end, FC Barcelona found themselves in crisis. Financially they were in debt. Professionally it has been Barça's one of the worst season (6th position in La Liga). In addition, there was a mutiny rising among the players against the then club's president Josep Lluís Núñez. It was known as the *Hesperia Mutiny* - disagreements over contracts, payments and taxes led to resistance from the first-team squad. The fans, who were irritated by Barça's poor performance in which they would finish in sixth place in La Liga, took the board's side. The dispute ended with the dismissal of 15 players and the coach (Luis Aragonés Suárez).\n",
    "\n",
    "With election dates nearing, Núñez needed a change to help re-establish his position at the club and help him win the election next year. So, on May 4, 1988, Núñez appointed Johan Cruyff as the new manager of FC Barcelona. It was a historic move - a move that changed FC Barcelona forever."

    "# Brief on La Masia\n",
    "\n",
    "La Masia, in its modern form, owes its existence partly to Josep Lluís Núñez. He appointed personnel to direct the youth setup - Jaume Amat as the head of youth football, Oriol Tort Martínez as the talent spotter, and others. It was Amat who proposed the creation of a residential home for young players. For this new project, the management planned *La Masia de Can Planes* as the centre-piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1972, Núñez's board appointed Laureano Ruiz Quevedo as the coach of Barça's Juvenil A side. It was Ruiz's work that helped Barça to develop a good youth team setup. He created a set of common traits within the youth academy. But, the problem lay in the difference with the first team. Different coaches directed the first team with their tactical ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "After he was appointed the head coach of FC Barcelona, Johan Cruyff, with his personality and authority, created a proper consistency between the youth teams and the first team. From 1988, every Barça's team, from youth level to the first team, became synonymous with playing a similar style of football. Each side shared similar training routines, which included quick attacking football, positional play and pressing. He also removed the notion of prioritizing physical attributes in young players. He wanted more technical young players in the academy."

    "\n",
    "In the 1987-88 season, 22 players played for FC Barcelona, of which 11 were from *La Masia*. It was a balanced team of academy graduates and other players. But because of the Hesperia Mutiny case and a bad performance throughout the season, Barça sold 15 players."

    "With the new signings made in the transfer window, the new season for FC Barcelona started on September 09, 1988, when they faced their neighbouring rivals RCD Espanyol at home. Barça went on to win the game 2-0 courtesy of the goals scored by Txiki Begiristain and Roberto Fernández. The season started well for Barça but, after a few games, they faced their first defeat under Johan Cruyff against their eternal rivals Real Madrid. Barça lost the first leg of the Supercup finals by 2-0. They managed to win the second leg by 2-1. But on aggregate, they lost the final to Real Madrid. The season went on for Barça, as in the end, they won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup defeating UC Sampdoria in the finals by 2-0. The Barça of the 1988-89 season was so much better than that of the previous season. They finished second in La Liga with 57 points, just behind Real Madrid by five points. They scored a total of 80 goals (second-best in the league) and conceded just 26 goals (best in the league).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup and a few others arrived at FC Barcelona in the following transfer window. Koeman and Laudrup would prove important figures in Cruyff's future *Dream Team*, but they failed to shine in their first season. Koeman, especially, had a disappointing season. The 1989-90 season saw Barça finishing at 3rd position in the league, 11 points behind Real Madrid and two points behind Valencia. The only thing that helped Cruyff keep his job was a 2-0 victory against Real Madrid in the finals of the King's Cup. At the end of the season, Núñez rejected a vote of no confidence from the *Socios* to sack Cruyff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1990-91 season saw the start of the *Dream Team*. Barça made a few more transfers before the new season. Hristo Stoichkov was one of the transfers, and he proved to be the final piece to complete the *Dream Team*. Barça took a hit before the end of the season as Johan Cruyff's greatest weakness came to horrify him. Being a chain-smoker since his teens, he underwent a double heart bypass surgery in 1991. During the last nine-game absence, Charly Rexach (Cruyff's assistant) took charge. And Barça secured the first league title in six years, breaking the monopoly of Real Madrid during that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "During his first three seasons, Cruyff managed to win three titles with Barça. He gave debuts to 12 academy graduates in his first three seasons, of which half of the debuts came in the 1990-91 season. Pep Guardiola was one of those six academy graduates."

    "The start to the season was not what FC Barcelona expected. In the first seven matches, in all competitions, they faced four defeats against Sevilla, Sporting de Gijón, Hansa Rostock and Real Oviedo. But slowly and steadily, they found their form. Barça won their first trophy of the season on October 29 1991, as they defeated Atlético de Madrid in the finals of the Spanish Supercup by 2-1 on aggregate. The most historic moment for FC Barcelona came on May 20 1992 - the final of the UEFA European Cup at Wembley. It was not their first final. Barça played in the finals of the European Cup on the previous two occasions. In the 1960–61 finals, they lost against SL Benfica by 3-2. And in the 1985–86 finals, they lost against FC Steaua București on penalties. This time it was different. This time they had a great team with a great manager."

In the last 15 games of the league, they won 13 times, drawing just twice. They won 28 out of 30 available points since losing 6-2 to Real Zaragoza in February and secured the league.

Barça only won the Spanish Supercup that season and came fourth in the league. In the following season (1995-96), Barça sold Hristo Stoichkov, Txiki Begiristain, Ronald Koeman and Eusebio. Now, only Albert Ferrer, Miguel Ángel Nadal, Pep Guardiola and José Mari Bakero remained. It was an end to the *Dream Team*. It was the first time since Cruyff has taken charge that Barça were unable to win a trophy. In La Liga, they finished third behind Atlético de Madrid and Valencia. Things became worse between Cruyff and president Núñez. Their discontent reached its peak. As a result of his disagreements with the president, in 1996, Cruyff left the club, bringing an end to his managerial career at FC Barcelona."
